## motivation

I imagine the inaugural meeting of every single academic publisher, conference or journal like this:

\- "I call agenda Item 27 j) What about our citation style?"    
\- "Do we really need one? There are already more than ten thousand of them around!"     
\- "They are all bad!"    
\- "Lousy!"    
\- "Boring!"    
\- "Unusable!"    
\- "Just use Harvard!"    
\- "LOL"   
\- "What does that even mean?" (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_690)    
\- "Let's make a new one, then!"    
[roaring applause]

The citation manager that I use (https://www.zotero.org/) comes with more than 8000 styles. I don't really have an explanation for this. I also have not found a single one that was relevant for me. Therefore I decided to write them myself and to provide them here. They are written in CSL (citation style language) and they are supposed to work with various citation software. Please check your documentation on how to use them with your style manager. More information is at https://citationstyles.org/.
