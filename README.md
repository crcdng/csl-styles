# csl-styles

## motivation

I imagine the inaugural meeting of every single academic publisher, conference or journal like this:

\- "I call agenda Item 27 j). What about our citation style?"    
\- "Do we really need a new one? There are already more than ten thousand of them around!"     
\- "They are all bad!"    
\- "Lousy!"    
\- "Boring!"    
\- "Unusable!"    
\- "Just use Harvard!"    
\- "LOL"   
\- "What does that even mean?" (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_690)    
\- "Let's make a new one, then!"    
[roaring applause]

The citation manager that I use (https://www.zotero.org/) comes with 9672 styles. I don't really have an explanation for this. Each of the publications. Therefore I decided to write them myself and to provide them here. They are written in CSL (citation style language) and they are supposed to work with various citation software. Please check your documentation on how to use them with your style manager. More information is at https://citationstyles.org/.

## styles

2. AISB convention https://aisb.org.uk/convention/
(work in progress)

3. RIFL Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio ISSN 2036-6728 http://www.rifl.unical.it/    
followed by a careful replacement of <code>», in</code> by <code>» in</code> in the bibliography. This has a few "specialities", e.g. the format of the bibliography changes substantially if there is an <code>original-date</code> entry. As a rule of thumb, if a journal uses [guillemets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillemet), it is weird.
